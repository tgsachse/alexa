# QueuePop

Still in development. The Alexa skill and the automatic queue acceptance work, but connecting the two scripts over the Internet is proving to be very complicated. Scalability is also a massive issue.

UPDATE #1: Networking is set up. Scalability is the challenge now. Will be uploading scripts that accept DOTA 2 queues soon and likely will combine with client.py script. May include a shell script for installation. PIP installation is also on the docket.
